abstract: 'We tested herein the hypothesis that exposure time significantly contributes to the vertical distribution profile of nematodes during a tidal cycle as a function of distinct feeding and locomotion behaviors, conditioned by body morphology. We showed that the vertical distribution profile of the slender with filiform tail, numerically dominant Terschellingia longicaudata is in fact significantly correlated with sediment changes induced by tidal variation. Conversely, none of the other nematode species showed unequivocal evidence of vertical migration. Horizontal spatial heterogeneity also influenced the vertical distribution of nematode associations, probably as a response to varying temperature and desiccation levels at the sediment surface. The resulting vertical profiles for individual or species groups are a trade-off among locomotory and feeding strategies and concordant morphological adaptations.'
