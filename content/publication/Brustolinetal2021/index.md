abstract: 'One of the challenges in modern ecology is reconciling how biotic interactions and
abiotic factors are interwoven drivers of community assembly. β-diversity is a measure
of the variation in species composition across space and time. The drivers of variability
in β-diversity are thus responsible for dictating the trajectory of assembling communities.
With data from multiscale surveys conducted in three marine intertidal sandflats,
we aimed to determine the relative importance and interdependencies of biotic engineering,
environment and spatial distances for β-diversity. In each sandflat, macrofauna
and environmental properties were assessed in 400 samples collected at different
spatial distances over 300 000 m2. The role of environmental variability in driving
patterns in β-diversity and species turnover was dependent on the abundances of ecosystem
engineers and spatial connectivity among seascapes as shown by the variance
explained by the interaction terms in the variance partitioning. Our results highlight
the interdependence between space, environment and species interactions in driving
community assembly. Given that most models aiming to explain β-diversity variation
only consider abiotic factors, our findings call for the incorporation of biotic interactions
into these models and we argue that this is essential for understanding resilience
to environmental change. The degree of interdependence between environment, space
and biotic interactions in driving ecological assembly is pivotal to our understanding
of how biodiversity will respond to predicted changes in habitats, environment and
key species distributions.'
